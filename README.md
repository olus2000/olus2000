# Henlo ,warld!

I'm Alex, a Polish college student, and I'm fascinated with the unconventional ways of interacting with computers, examples including:

* Concatenative programming
* Esoteric languages
* [PICO-8](https://lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) fantasy console

I'm trying to share my interests and the knowlege I gather exploring them on my [dev.to blog](https://dev.to/olus2000) and a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxfKaL7jwqXjODoLeeN3AIg), both named Alex Esoposting. I'm also the developer of [NPTimelapse](https://olus2000.pl/nptimelapse), a game recording and replaying tool for the online strategy masterpiece Neptune's Pride.

If you want to find out more about me see my repos, [my homepage](https://olus2000.pl) and if you want to support me and my projects I'm open for donations on LiberaPay.
