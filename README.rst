I'm Alex, a programmer from Poland, and I'm fascinated with the unconventional
ways of interacting with computers, examples including:

* Concatenative programming
* Esoteric languages
* `PICO-8`_ fantasy console

I'm trying to share my interests and the knowlege I gather exploring them on my
`dev.to blog`_ and a `youtube channel`_, both named Alex Esoposting. I'm also
the developer of `NPTimelapse`_, a game recording and replaying tool for the
online strategy masterpiece Neptune's Pride, and I made an online tool for
playing around with concatenative calculus, creatively called
`Concatenative Evaluator`_.

If you want to find out more about me see my repos, `my homepage`_ and if you
want to support me and my projects I'm open for donations on LiberaPay.
